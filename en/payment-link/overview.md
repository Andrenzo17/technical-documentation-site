If the transaction is directed towards a specific customer, the Payment Link will be sent straight to the specified customer’s email address. Expiration Date is the last day the Payment Link can be used and accessed.

## Managing Payment Link

After creating the Payment Link, you will be redirected to the Payment Link List page where you can view a list of Payment Links created. You can copy and share any of your links to your customers. You can also see details and delete your links from this page.

When you click Details, you will be shown a page with all of the details of the Payment Link. Here you can also view the number of Orders of the Payment Link and clicking the number will show you the orders on the transaction page.

## Payment Link Page

When you send the Payment Link to customers, they can open the link and it will direct them to Midtrans' Payment Page. If there is no specified customer, the customer will first need to input their details (Name, Phone, and Email) to continue. Next, the user will need to choose a payment method and follow the payment instructions. Once the customer has completed the payment, you will receive a notification of the transaction.
