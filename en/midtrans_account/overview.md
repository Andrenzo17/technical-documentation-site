# Midtrans Account

<TODO: elaborate about the basic of registering account to getting server key>

Before integrating with Midtrans, you need to register [here]([https://account.midtrans.com/register](https://account.midtrans.com/register)). After completing the registration you will be given access to your Merchant Administration Portal (MAP), where you shall have access to both sandbox and production environment. Access Keys are used to access Midtrans’ API. You can find them in Settings > Access Keys. The Access Keys are unique for every merchant. Please always keep it confidential.

You can use the sandbox environment during your development phase of integrating Midtrans’ payments system. You can also test dummy transactions on sandbox environment. The production environment is also available, but your production credentials will only be ready once you have completed all the necessary administrative steps.
