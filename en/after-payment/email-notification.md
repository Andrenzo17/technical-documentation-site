# Email Notification
<hr>

Whenever transaction status changes: success, failure, cancel, etc. Midtrans by default will notify by email the status of the transaction to Merchant email (email configured on dashboard) & Customer email (email inputted on Snap payment page). 

Feel free to try create transaction on Sandbox mode, to see and test email notification that will be sent to you.

Merchant can configure the email notification setting at [Settings - Email Notification](https://dashboard.sandbox.midtrans.com/settings/email_notifications) in Dashboard.
