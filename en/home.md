Not familiar with programming, technical integration, and all the complexity? Here are a few ways for you to integrate with Midtrans without any technical knowledge:

- Simplest way to use Midtrans to accept payment without website or technical knowledge is via [**Payment Link**](/en/payment-link/overview.md). You only need to login via a web browser to Midtrans Dashboard, generate payment link, and then send the link to your customers.

- You can use ready to use Content Management System (CMS) to create online store. If you are familiar with setting up CMS (**WordPress - WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop, OpenCart, WHMCS**, and so on), you can install Midtrans plugin/extension to start accepting payment right away! The payment status feature on the CMS will automatically be updated in real time using the payment status provided by Midtrans. Check out [Midtrans list of supported CMS plugin/extension](/en/snap/with-plugins.md).

- You can also integrate Midtrans to third party e-commerce solution (**Shopify, Sirclo, Jejualan**, and so on) to start accepting payments. These third-party e-commerce solutions are user-friendly and require very minimal setup. Check out [Midtrans list of supported 3rd party Ecommerce platform](/en/snap/platform/overview.md).
